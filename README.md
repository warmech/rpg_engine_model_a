This game engine is meant to be port of SaGa 2 (Final Fantasy Legend II in the US/EU) to Windows/MacOS/Linux by means of Lua and Love2D. It is really just a modest attempt at learning how to build a video game using a pre-existing template and resources, but forcing me to learn to code and come up with methods of accomplishing goals.
